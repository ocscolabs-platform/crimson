# Staging Task Queue

This queue records approved next-step work before implementation. Tasks in this file are not production changes until they are implemented, reviewed in staging, and explicitly promoted to `main`.

## STG-001 — Add a contact form workflow after capability exploration

- **Status:** Planned for staging
- **Related experience:** Homepage `Explore the capabilities` CTA and `/services`
- **Goal:** Give visitors a clear path from reviewing OCSCO capabilities to starting a qualified conversation through the approved contact workflow.
- **UX rule:** Keep `Explore the capabilities` as a discovery link to `/services`. Do not turn it into a form-submission action. Add the form on `/contact` and/or introduce a contextual `Discuss this capability` action after a visitor has explored a capability.

### Acceptance criteria

- The response owner and submission destination are approved before implementation.
- The final field list, required fields, privacy copy, validation, error state, success state, and confirmation behavior are approved.
- The form works with keyboard navigation, visible focus, readable labels, mobile layouts, and accessible error messaging.
- Capability context can be carried into the inquiry when a visitor arrives from a service or capability CTA.
- The form is tested in staging without adding credentials, tokens, or production integrations to the repository.
- Production promotion happens only after an owner review of the full submission workflow.

### Dependencies

- Confirm whether submissions should use an approved email workflow first or a future Supabase-backed inquiry record.
- Confirm the response time expectation and who owns follow-up.
- Approve the contact form content and privacy/consent requirements.
