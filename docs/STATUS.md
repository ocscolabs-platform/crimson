# Project Status

## Current Phase

**Phase 4 — Custom CMS Foundation**

Phase 0 through Phase 3 are complete. The public route structure, visual system, environment-specific contact workflow, production metadata, and domain release are implemented. Phase 4 is active with a reviewed CMS schema and published-only read boundary. Services, Work, and shared global content are being reviewed in staging. CRM, CMS admin UI, media storage, and authentication remain unimplemented.

## Completed

- Connected the local project workspace to the empty GitHub repository `ocscolabs-platform/crimson`.
- Added the repository operating contract in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added setup, structure, and validation guidance in `README.md`.
- Added project vision, architecture, deployment, decision log, and status documentation.
- Added a minimal Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint application shell.
- Added `.env.example` with variable names and comments only.
- Added Git ignore rules for dependencies, build output, local environment files, and secrets.
- Created the initial local foundation commit.
- Pushed the foundation to GitHub on the `main` branch.
- Connected the repository to Vercel and verified the live foundation deployment.
- Added the Phase 1 information architecture, content model, and acceptance criteria documents.
- Reviewed the existing OCSCO Brand Style Guide as the reference for Phase 2 direction.
- Added Phase 2 content briefs, visual design direction, and acceptance criteria.
- Implemented the first public homepage slice with responsive layout, shared visual tokens, capability sections, approach, contact CTA, and honest proof-state copy.
- Inspected the homepage at desktop and mobile viewport sizes with no browser console errors.
- Added route shells for Services, five service detail pages, Work, About, and Contact.
- Added structured local service content and generated static service detail routes.
- Smoke-tested all public routes and confirmed page titles and H1 content.
- Promoted the reviewed Phase 3 contact workflow to `main` in commit `1dc5c54`.
- Applied the Production `public.inquiries` migration to the selected clean Supabase project.
- Configured separate Production Supabase and Resend variables in Vercel, including the verified `send.ocsco.io` sender domain.
- Confirmed the Production inquiry row and owner email notification.
- Switched `ocsco.io` and `www.ocsco.io` from WordPress DNS to Vercel.
- Added the Phase 4 CMS foundation scope and an RLS-protected relational migration for settings, navigation, pages, services, and case studies.

## In Progress

- Review the Phase 4 CMS foundation and global content seed in staging.
- Complete live QA of CMS-backed Services, Work, navigation, footer settings, and page metadata before broader CMS work.
- Complete owner content, accessibility, and privacy/consent follow-up from the technical release.

## Blocked / Requires Owner Action

- Configure GitHub branch protection for `feature/*`, `staging`, and `main`.
- Provide approved case-study facts, outcomes, testimonials, team details, and contact destination before implementation.
- Confirm which visual assets from the existing brand materials may be copied into Crimson.
- Keep WordPress hosting available during the short rollback window, then cancel it after final owner confirmation.

No account IDs, URLs, domains, credentials, or production secrets were fabricated or added.

## Next Recommended Step

Apply the global content seed to the dedicated staging Supabase project, verify published-only reads across the shared shell and top-level pages, then review the result before planning the protected CMS editor. Do not apply the staging seed to Production or build admin authentication until the read boundary is accepted. Future guide changes must be versioned as v1.1 or v2.0 and approved before production promotion.
